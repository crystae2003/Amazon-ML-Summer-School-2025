# Amazon ML Summer School 2025
Amazon ML Summer School 2025

I was selected among a limited cohort of students across India for Amazon ML Summer School 2025, organized by Amazon. The program offered in-depth exposure to core and advanced ML concepts, including Supervised Learning, Deep Neural Networks, Dimensionality Reduction, Unsupervised Learning, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Sequential Models, Causal Inference, and Reinforcement Learning.

Through interactive sessions with Amazon scientists, I strengthened my understanding of statistical foundations, model evaluation, and real-world ML applications. The experience enhanced my problem-solving approach and gave me valuable insight into how Amazon leverages ML at scale.
